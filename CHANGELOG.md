## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.21] - 2026-06-19

### Added

* 🔀 **Per-Request Header Injection for HTTP MCP Transports**: Added an HTTP client factory for SSE and Streamable HTTP transports that injects forwarded client headers at request time, enabling request-scoped propagation without changing global transport headers.

### Changed

* 🔒 **Serialized Forwarded Header Scope in Reconnect-Aware Calls**: MCP tool execution now wraps reconnect and invocation flow in a forwarding-headers context with locking so concurrent requests do not leak forwarded headers across sessions.

### Fixed

* 🔤 **Case-Insensitive Header Pattern Matching**: Client header forwarding pattern matching now compares header names and wildcard prefixes case-insensitively, ensuring configured patterns consistently match real-world HTTP header casing.

## [0.0.20] - 2026-02-27

### Added

* 🔁 **MCP Connection Manager with Auto-Reconnect**: Introduced MCPConnectionManager to manage the full lifecycle of MCP client sessions and transports. Connections that drop due to a ClosedResourceError are now automatically re-established and retried transparently, eliminating manual restarts for intermittent server disconnects.
* 🔄 **Automatic Retry on Closed Sessions**: Tool calls that encounter a ClosedResourceError will now automatically reconnect to the MCP server and retry the call, providing resilient end-to-end execution without user intervention.

### Changed

* 🧩 **Normalized disabledTools Configuration Key**: The disabled tools setting now accepts both camelCase (disabledTools) and snake_case (disabled_tools) in the config file for backwards compatibility and consistency with other configuration keys.
* 🧹 **Simplified Tool Handler Architecture**: Refactored get_tool_handler to remove the session parameter and nested factory functions in favor of a cleaner design that resolves the session from the request app state at call time, enabling reconnect-aware tool execution.
* 🛡️ **Guarded Lifespan Startup During Hot Reload**: The reload handler now checks for the presence of an async context manager before awaiting sub-app lifespan startup, preventing errors when lifespan context is unavailable.

### Fixed

* 🪛 **Fixed Erroneous Validation Raise in disabledTools**: Removed a misplaced raise statement in validate_server_config that would always throw an error after validating disabled_tools, even when the configuration was correct.
* 🧯 **Graceful Handling of asyncio.CancelledError**: Added explicit CancelledError handling during server creation and lifespan startup to properly roll back routes and log errors instead of crashing silently.

## [0.0.19] - 2025-10-14

### Fixed

* 🔁 **Reverted Client Header Forwarding**: Reverted changes introduced in 0.0.18.

## [0.0.18] - 2025-10-14

### Added

* 🧩 **OAuth Support for Streamable HTTP Servers**: Introduced full OAuth 2.0 support with dynamic client registration for 'streamable_http' MCP servers. This enables secure, standards-compliant authentication flows for both user and service clients.
* 🔧 **Configurable Disabled Tools**: Added 'disabled_tools' option in server configuration, allowing selective disabling of specific tools without modifying code. Useful for managing staged rollouts or limited-access environments.
* 🧠 **Adjustable Log Level at Runtime**: Logging verbosity can now be adjusted dynamically, giving operators finer control over monitoring and debugging noise without requiring restarts.
* 🔁 **Client Header Forwarding**: Added automatic forwarding of client HTTP headers to MCP backends—enabling trace propagation, correlation IDs, and richer observability in distributed environments.
* 🛤️ **Support for Custom Path Prefixes**: Servers can now run under a custom path prefix, allowing flexible deployment within multi-service gateways or reverse proxy environments.
* 📄 **Root Path Documentation**: Added documentation describing behavior and configuration for root path handling in multi-app or nested setups.

### Changed

* 🧰 **Refactored Connection Timeout Defaults**: Connection timeout is now set to 'None' by default to prevent premature disconnects during long-running or streaming tasks.
* 🧹 **Removed Deprecated Python Version Tagging**: Dropped explicit Python version tagging; the project now officially supports Python 3.11 and above without manual tagging overhead.

### Fixed

* 🪛 **Improved Hot Reload Lifespan Tracking**: Fixed an issue where sub-applications created during hot reloads were not properly initialized or cleaned up—ensuring stable lifecycle management during dynamic reconfiguration.
* 🔗 **Symlink Handling in Config Watcher**: Resolved a bug where configuration symlinks were not updating correctly on modification; watcher now tracks and reloads the proper file path automatically.
